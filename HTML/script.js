Hello Everyone!
Today I have shared with you few coding problems. Please solve and reply your answer.
1. Create a function that takes two numbers as input and uses async/await to divide the first number by the second number. If the division is successful, log the result to the console. If there is an error (e.g. the second number is 0), catch it and log an error message.

2. Create a function that takes a string as input and uses async/await to read a file with that name from the local file system. If the file is successfully read, log its contents to the console. If there is an error (e.g. the file does not exist), catch it and log an error message.

3.Create a function that takes a URL as input and uses async/await to fetch data from the API at that URL. If the fetch is successful, parse the JSON data and return it. If there is an error, catch it and return an empty object.
